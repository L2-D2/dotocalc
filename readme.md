## It Does:

* Can choose hero
* Can find stats from hero and level
* Can select items
* Calculates bonus dmg from items
* Calculates bonus attack speed from items
* Calculates relevant armor bonuses


## It Should:

* calculate other bonuses from items
  * Bonus stats
  * Crits
* care about damage block at all
* factor in distance and projectile speed
* look at draft compatibility
* look at draft counter-picks
* calculate item effectiveness
* calculate optimal dmg outputs

### Eventually:
* look at player compatibility
* help find lacking areas to improve
	* heroes to practice
	* strategies to try

## Notes:

If you wish to download the jsons and load them locally in Chrome, you will need to use the `--allow-file-access-from-files` launch option.
Doing so can reduce bandwidth usage to potentially 0 if done so with all the external files.
